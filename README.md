# QRadar-siem-firewall-response
Automated blocking of malicious IP addresses on pfSense firewall in response to QRadar SIEM correlation rules

This project demonstrates how to extend QRadar's **Custom Rule Engine (CRE) actions** to dynamically add or remove IP addresses from a pfSense firewall alias. The result is automated threat response (SOAR-lite) without needing extra tools.
