### 1. Attack Simulation

I am going to simulate a brute force attack by attemting RDP connection to my Windows Server (Domain Controller) with wrong credentials from my host PC which is on a different network.

The logs are comming in on QRadar (`User Login Failure`) below with the source ip `192.168.178.1` which belongs to my host PC (Attacker) and a destination ip `10.10.1.10` which belongs to my Windows Server.

All i need to do is repeat the process 10 times wihtin 5 minutes and an offense get triggered which activates the custom action for the automated response.

After trying to login with wrong credentials at least 10 times, the rule I created triggered an offense and activated the custom action response which automatically added the malicious IP address to the qradar_blocklist on the firewall which effectively blocked any further connections to our LAN network.

The following image shows the event that triggered the offense `Failure Audit: An account failed to log on` and also events on QRadar from our firewall within the same minute showing SSH connections from QRadar `10.10.1.110` to the Firewall `10.10.1.1` to run the command to add the malicious ip to the block list with the user `qradar_usr` as specified in the custom action bash script.

The image below shows the logs of the action taken on the firewall at `23:37:52 (11:37:52 PM)` which is just over 10 seconds from the event time of `11:37:41 PM` which triggered the offense.
