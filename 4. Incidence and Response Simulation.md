### 1. Attack Simulation

I am going to simulate a brute force attack by attemting RDP connection to my Windows Server (Domain Controller) with wrong credentials from my host PC which is on a different network.

The logs are comming in on QRadar (`User Login Failure`) below with the source ip `192.168.178.1` which belongs to my host PC (Attacker) and a destination ip `10.10.1.10` which belongs to my Windows Server.

All i need to do is repeat the process 10 times wihtin 5 minutes and an offense get triggered which activates the custom action for the automated response.
